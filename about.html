         <h1>About Himalayas</h1>
         <br>
         <br>
          <h3>
            The Himalayas, or Himalaya are a mountain range in Asia separating the 
            <br>
            plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau.
            <br>
            <br>
            The range has some of the planet's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Over 100 peaks exceeding 7,200 m (23,600 ft) in elevation lie in the Himalayas. 
            <br>
            <br>
            By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia (Aconcagua, in the Andes) is 6,961 m (22,838 ft) tall.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Himalayas abut or cross five countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, and Pakistan. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The sovereignty of the range in the Kashmir region is disputed between India, Pakistan, and China.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, 
            <br>
            on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the world's major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra, 
            <br>
            rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people;
            <br>
            53 million people live in the Himalayas.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet; 
            <br>
            many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism.
<br>
<br>
            Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate, 
            <br>
            the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km (1,500 mi) long .
            <br>
            <br>
            Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river.
            <br>
            <br>
            Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River.
            <br>
            <br>
            The range varies in width from 350 km (220 mi) in the west to 150 km (93 mi) in the east.
